!!! note "Pyrotech in 1.14.4 and beyond!"
    Hi, I'm Codetaylor, the creator of Pyrotech and I would love to work on moving the mod to more recent versions of Minecraft. If you'd like to see Pyrotech move beyond 1.12.2, [click here to read more about my campaign to make that happen](https://bit.ly/2KaxA3Hd)!

### Class

```java
import mods.pyrotech.DurableRockBag;
```

#### Methods

```java
static void setGameStages(
  Stages stages // game stages
);
```

Sets game stage logic required to use the device.
