## Alternate Textures

The refractory, or brick, machines each have an alternate texture.

By default, the machines look like they are partly made from iron, but this may not fit thematically with your pack's progression.

Each device can have its texture toggled in `module.tech.Machine.cfg`, search for `USE_IRON_SKIN`.
